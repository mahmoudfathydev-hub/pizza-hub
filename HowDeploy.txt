## 🛠️ Step 1: Prepare Your Project

### 1.1 Check Your Package.json
Open your `package.json` file and make sure it has these scripts:

```json
{
  "name": "food-ordering",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint",
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Create Vercel Config File
Create a new file called `vercel.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

### 1.3 Test Locally
Make sure everything works locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to confirm it works.

## 🗄️ Step 2: Set Up Neon Database

### 2.1 Create Neon Database
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and log in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Give it a name: `pizzahub-db`
4. Choose a region (pick one close to you)
5. Click "Create Project"

### 2.2 Get Your Database URL
1. After creation, you'll see your dashboard
2. Click "Connection details"
3. Copy the "Connection string" - it looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
   ```

### 2.3 Update Your Local Database
1. Open your `.env.local` file (create if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your Neon database URL:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-connection-string-here"
```

### 2.4 Set Up Database Tables
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push your database schema to Neon
npx prisma db push
```

If successful, you'll see: "Database schema is up to date"

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

### 3.1 Create Environment Variables File
Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root:

```env
# Database (from Neon)
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-connection-string-here"

# NextAuth - Generate secrets below
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Cloudinary - Get from cloudinary.com
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

### 3.2 Generate NextAuth Secret
Run this command to generate a secure secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the output and paste it as `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

### 3.3 Get Cloudinary Keys (Optional)
If you want image uploads:
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Get your Cloud name, API Key, and API Secret from dashboard
4. Add them to your `.env.local`

---

## 📤 Step 4: Push to GitHub

### 4.1 Initialize Git
If you haven't already:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial PizzaHub setup"
```

### 4.2 Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `pizzahub-food-ordering`
4. Choose "Public" or "Private"
5. Click "Create repository"

### 4.3 Push Your Code
Copy the commands GitHub shows you, or use:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pizzahub-food-ordering.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

### 5.1 Import Your Project
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Find your `pizzahub-food-ordering` repository
4. Click "Import"

### 5.2 Configure Vercel Project
Vercel will auto-detect Next.js. You'll see:

```
Project Name: pizzahub-food-ordering
Framework Preset: Next.js
Root Directory: ./
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: .next
Install Command: npm install
```

Click "Continue".

### 5.3 Add Environment Variables
This is important! Add your production environment variables:

1. Click "Environment Variables"
2. Add these one by one:

```
DATABASE_URL = your-neon-connection-string-here
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://pizzahub-food-ordering.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = your-secret-key-here
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your-api-secret
```

**Important**: Use the same secrets from your `.env.local` file, but update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your Vercel URL.

### 5.4 Deploy!
Click "Deploy" and wait. Vercel will:
1. Install your dependencies
2. Build your Next.js app
3. Deploy it to their global network

This takes 2-5 minutes.

## ✅ Step 6: Verify Your Deployment

### 6.1 Check Your Website
1. Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://pizzahub-food-ordering.vercel.app`
2. Click it to visit your deployed site
3. Test all pages:
   - Home page loads
   - Menu page works
   - Admin dashboard accessible
   - Login/Signup works

### 6.2 Test Database Connection
1. Try to create a new user account
2. Try to add a product in admin panel
3. If it works, your database is connected!

### 6.3 Test Image Uploads (If using Cloudinary)
1. Go to admin panel
2. Try to add a new product with an image
3. Check if the image appears correctly

## 🛠️ Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: "Database connection failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
- Make sure it's the exact same as your Neon connection string
- Redeploy after fixing

### Problem 2: "NextAuth error"
**Solution**:
- Make sure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is at least 32 characters
- Check that `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your Vercel URL exactly
